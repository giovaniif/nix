<h2>🏷️ About</h2>

The project ideia came up as a solution for our **undergraduate thesis** (TCC, in portuguese). The purpose was to create a place where vegan or vegetarian people would be able to connect and share their experiences.

<h2>🚀 Techs</h2>

This project was created using [Expo](https://github.com/expo/expo) and [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript). But a few other nice libs were used.

- [Unform](https://github.com/unform/unform)
- [React Navigation](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation)
- [React Native Animatable](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-animatable)
